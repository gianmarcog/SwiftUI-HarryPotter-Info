# AppDelegate

This class is supposed to be there to handle application lifecycle events - i.e., responding to the app being launched, backgrounded, foregrounded, receiving data, and so on. 

# SceneDelegate
This is a result of the new multi-window support that landed with iPadOS, and effectively splits the work of the app delegate in two. </br>
But fpr this project its unnessesary
